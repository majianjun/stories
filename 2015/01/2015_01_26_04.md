# 梦

	梦里
	
	我去你的学校找你
	
	我们见了面
	     却跟未见面一样
	
	我坐在教室里听一堂数学课
	     似乎我很喜欢这场面
	
	两三个学生
	     意外地制造着混乱
	
	课堂上
	     始终没有看到你
	
	于是我醒了
	     于是我笑了

	In the dream
	
	I went to your school and looked for you
		We met but just like I haven't seen you

	I sat in the classroom and listen to a math class
		Its seems I like this scene

	Two or three students accidentally created a mess

	I didn't see you in the classroom

	So I woke up

	So I laughed
